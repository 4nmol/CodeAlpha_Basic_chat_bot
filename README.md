# CodeAlpha_Basic_chat_bot

Basic Chatbot Project 🤖💬

I completed a Basic Chatbot project as an intern at Code Alpha 💻. This chatbot interacts with users, answering basic questions and providing responses based on predefined scripts! 🧠

Key Features:
Natural Language Processing: The chatbot understands simple user inputs. 🗣️
Predefined Responses: Responds to specific keywords or phrases. 🔑
User Interaction: Engages in conversations and provides helpful answers. 🤝
Simple Interface: Easy-to-use text interface for chatting. 🖥️
Learning Opportunity: Enhanced understanding of Python and chatbot logic. 📚
This project improved my skills in Python programming 🐍 and Natural Language Processing (NLP), giving me a hands-on experience in building interactive applications with Code Alpha. 🌟
